# Stock Picker

This is a solution to the stock picker problem.

## Overview

### The challenge

A method called stock_picker should be implemented that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

## My Process

### Built with

- Ruby

### What I Learned

I learned about the syntax of loops, conditionals, and arrays in Ruby.

### Continued development

I am interested in developing a front end for this piece of logic with new tools and frameworks as I learn them.

### Useful resources
